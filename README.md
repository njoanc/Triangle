### Specs for a triangle

The application should tell me what type of triangle my values will produce:

1. input:all sides must be equal
   output:Triangle is Equilateral
2. input: Two sides are exactly equal
   output: Triangle is isoscele
3. input: none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
   output: Triangle is Scalene
4. input: If the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side
   output: Triangle can not be formed
