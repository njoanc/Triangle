    <h2>Types of Triangles</h2>
    <p>
      Shapes are part of our daily life and it is important to understand each
      and every shape. The most common shape we see around is the triangle. The
      shape with three corners are commonly known as the triangle but every
      three-cornered shape is not the same, and to understand this concept we
      are here to explain you with different types of triangles.

      Triangle is a three-sided polygon. This closed figure consists of three
      lines which are linked at the endpoint to each other. The main properties
      of the triangle are that the sum of the interior angle of the triangle
      will be 180° and the sum of the exterior angles will be 360° always.
      Triangle can be classified according to their sides and interior angles.
      Following are the details about each qualification.

      <li id="equilateral">Equilateral Triangle</li>
      <p>
        This type of triangle consists of three equal sides and equal angles.
        Every side of the triangle is of the same length and every angle will be
        of the same measure of 60°. The following figure is an equilateral
        triangle

      <li id="isosceles">Isosceles triangle</li>
      <p>
        The triangle with only two equal sides is known as the isosceles
        triangle. Not only two equal sides, the isosceles triangle also consists
        of two equal angles. The following figure is of the isosceles triangle

      <li id="scalene">Scalene Triangle</li>
      <p>
        The triangle with no equal sides is the scalene triangle. Each line of
        this triangle is of different length. Following is the figure of the
        scalene triangle:
